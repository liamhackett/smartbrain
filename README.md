TODO:
- Fix responsiveness

Ideas to improve project:
- Add ranking on another page and show the leaderboards highlighting the signed in user
- Add a home page/landing page explaining whats going on
    - Have a button that says Demo or try now
- Maybe find an interesting font for the SmartBrain title
